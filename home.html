I will thus tell you that you are blessed to be alive and well today, but I will also tell you that you it's disheartening that you don't know who your Creator is. We live for the Lord, which is a reality that not everyone can embrace. Since He is the source of all of us, He also deserves our lives. We might not realize as young people that our purpose in life is to exalt the Lord. Why not? Because humans are fundamentally prideful and selfcentered.",

I had no idea. What is it? That's a very good question. And the good news is that you don't have to overthink everything or attempt to figure it all out on your own; God will reveal His plan for your life as you seek Him. Live your life with faith and confidence in Him, and He will lead you through every step of the way.",

We also question about our relationship statuses, attractiveness, grades, and reputation to get a sense of identity. Any or all of these may seem like solid foundations, yet none of them are permanent. Any of these may change without notice. If you rely on your identity upon achievement, fame, power, physical appearance, and other factors, you are setting yourself up for disapointment.", "In Romans 8:18 Paul says, “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.",
